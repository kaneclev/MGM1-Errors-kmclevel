| Compiler   | spie.h   | Syntax error with ostream; std:: needed                                                                             | Declare ostream with std::                                                                |  
| Compiler   | spie.cpp | The constructor was missing SPIE_Game:: for declaration as a constructor; it appeared as a function instead         | Include SPIE_Game::                                                                       |
| Compiler   | spie.cpp | The while loop on line 36 has an improper stop condition                                                            | Instead of OR operators, use && operators and extend the statement                        |
| Compiler   | spie.cpp | The get_player_choice function was supposed to return char, but didnt return                                        | Make the function return char choice                                                      |
| Compiler   | main.cpp | When creating an instance of SPIE_Game, there were parens at the end of the declaration, implying it is a function. | Remove the parens so that it is just creating an object                                   |
| Compiler   | main.cpp | When trying to print winning numbers, there are no parens for the function and no parameter given.                  | Create parens and give the function a parameter (cout)                                    |
| Compiler   | main.cpp | No curly brackets around switch statement to enclose cases                                                          | Include brackets containing the cases so the compiler knows the entirety of the statement |
| Compiler   | main.cpp | 'if' checker to see if score == 0 was outside of the correct function                                               | Move the if statement within the correct brackets                                         | 
| Compiler   | main.cpp | 'return 0' lacked a semicolon, stopping the build of the executable                                                 | Add the semicolon.                                                                        |
