| Compiler   | spie.cpp | The constructor was missing SPIE_Game:: for declaration as a constructor; it appeared as a function instead                                               | Include SPIE_Game::                                                                                                       |
| Compiler   | spie.cpp | The while loop on line 36 has an improper stop condition                                                                                                  | Instead of OR operators, use && operators and extend the statement                                                        |
| Compiler   | spie.cpp | The get_player_choice function was supposed to return char, but didnt return                                                                              | Make the function return char choice                                                                                      |
| Compiler   | main.cpp | When creating an instance of SPIE_Game, there were parens at the end of the declaration, implying it is a function.                                       | Remove the parens so that it is just creating an object                                                                   |
| Compiler   | main.cpp | When trying to print winning numbers, there are no parens for the function and no parameter given.                                                        | Create parens and give the function a parameter (cout)                                                                    |
| Compiler   | main.cpp | No curly brackets around switch statement to enclose cases                                                                                                | Include brackets containing the cases so the compiler knows the entirety of the statement                                 |
| Compiler   | main.cpp | 'if' checker to see if score == 0 was outside of the correct function                                                                                     | Move the if statement within the correct brackets                                                                         | 
| Compiler   | main.cpp | 'return 0' lacked a semicolon, stopping the build of the executable                                                                                       | Add the semicolon.                                                                                                        |
| Compiler   | main.cpp | Included 'spie.cpp' instead of the header file 'spie.h' causing duplicate symbol errors.                                                                  | Include spie.h instead of spie.cpp.                                                                                       | 
| Logic      | main.cpp | In the 'i', or info part of the switch, we still move to playing the game even after showing info.                                                        | Instead of 'break', insert 'continue' so it reprompts the user for input.                                                 |
| Logic      | main.cpp | In the while loop, the 'e' choice still gave output besides just "Play again later!"                                                                      | Change the condition of the switch & loop such that when 'e' is given, the program prints then stops as per spec.         |
| Logic      | spie.cpp | add_winning_numbers() wont add numbers when called from the constructor because the loop condition is i < winning_numbers.size(), which is zero to start. | Change the function such that if the winning_numbers vec is empty to start, we will add the two starting winning numbers. |
